What is the goial of this project?

The goal of this project is to simulate flipping a coin, and print the results. Then find how lonmg it takes to get N Heads or N tails in a row.
The program will report:
 - "The total number of coin flips required"
 - "Which side of the coin achived the streak"
 - "The target streak length N"

How do I know when thus program is finished?

- The program will stop automatically once the streak reaches N
- N can be chnaged per the users request
- The output is clear and correct

Example of Output:

- It took 48 flips to reach 5 heads in a row!

Code

allow user to input N

loop of coin flip
track the current streak of results
reset streak if results change
stop when target == N
