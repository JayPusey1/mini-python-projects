Python Mini Projects

What is the goal of this repository?

The goal of this repository is to build and improve core programming skills through small, self-contained Python projects.
Each project focuses on different programming concepts such as:
 - Control flow
 - Input validation
 - Randomness
 - Game logic
 - State management
 - Problem-solving

These projects are built without following step-by-step tutorials or using AI. They were made using documentation and independent problem-solving to strengthen real development skills.

What projects are included?

1️⃣ Coin Flip Streak Simulator

Goal:

Simulate flipping a coin until a target number of consecutive heads or tails is reached.

Skills Used:

 - Loops (while)
 - Random number generation
 - Streak tracking logic
 - Conditional statements
 - Basic simulation thinking

Future Improvements:

 - Run multiple simulations and calculate averages
 - Display probability statistics
 - Graph results

2️⃣ Number Guessing Game

Goal:

The program generates a random number between 1–1000 and the user must guess it using “Higher” or “Lower” feedback.

Skills Used:

 - Input validation
 - Loop control
 - Conditional branching
 - Counter tracking
 - User feedback logic

Future Improvements:

 - Difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
 - Limited guesses mode
 - Score tracking system
 - Best score persistence
 - GUI version

3️⃣ Rock-Paper-Scissors (Best of 3)

Goal:

Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer in a best-of-three match.

Skills Used:

 - String handling
 - Conditional combinations
 - Score tracking
 - Match logic
 - Game loop structure

Future Improvements:

 - Add difficulty levels
 - Track win history
 - GUI version
 - Smarter AI logic instead of random selection

4️⃣ Tic-Tac-Toe (Player vs Computer)

Goal:

Create a fully playable Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against a computer opponent.

Skills Used:

 - Board representation using lists
 - Index mapping (1–9 input to 0–8 array)
 - Win condition detection
 - Turn switching
 - Game loop control
 - Random move generation
 - Input validation
 - Basic game engine structure

Future Improvements

 - Smarter AI (block opponent / take winning move)
 - Unbeatable AI
 - Best-of-three match mode
 - Difficulty levels
 - Graphical user interface version

How do I know this repository is successful?

 - Each project runs correctly and meets its defined goal
 - Input is validated properly
 - Game logic functions correctly
 - Code is structured and readable
 - More advanced versions are built over time

Future Planned Projects

Some upcoming mini-project ideas include:

 - Blackjack game
 - Connect Four
 - Hangman
 - Simple text-based RPG
 - File-based To-Do app
 - Password generator
 - Basic sorting visualiser
 - CLI calculator with advanced operations
 - Data structure visualisation projects
 - Pathfinding visualisation (BFS / DFS)

Why This Repository Exists

This repository represents ongoing progress in developing problem-solving ability and programming fundamentals.

The focus is not on complexity, but on:

 - Writing clean logic
 - Understanding how programs flow
 - Building confidence with independent coding
 - Iteratively improving projects over time

More advanced versions of these projects will continue to be added.
