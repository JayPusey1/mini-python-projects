What is the goial of this project?

The goal of this project is to make a number guessing game where they program will pick a number from 1-1000 and then the user will have to guess the number, using feedback such as Higher or Lower.

The program will report:
 - "What the random number was"
 - "How many guesses it took the user to reach the goal number"

How do I know when thus program is finished?

- The program will genrate a new random number every time we run the file
- The program will correctly identify if the users guess is higher or lower than the target number
- The program finishes when the user guesses the target number correctly
- The output is clear and correct

Example of Output:

- It took 7 guesses to reach the target number, which was 827!
