What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to create a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against a computer opponent.
The program will:
 - Display a 3x3 game board
 - Randomly assign the user to be X or O
 - Alternate turns between the user and the computer
 - Detect when a player has achieved three in a row
 - Detect when the game ends in a draw

How do I know when this program is finished?

 - The program correctly displays and updates the board after each move
 - The user can only select valid squares (1–9 and not already taken)
 - The computer selects a valid empty square randomly
 - The program correctly detects:
 - A win (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
 - A draw (board is full with no winner)
 - The game ends immediately when a win or draw is detected
 - The output is clear and correct

Example of Output:

You are X
You are O
X goes first
